We are pleased to announce that Maureen’s Readers has received the [Scholastic Literacy Partnership](http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/literacypartnerships/our-mission.html) designation and contract from Scholastic Books. This will allow us to purchase books at a discount and will be eligible for other benefits, including free books. We are delighted with this and feel that it will greatly enhance our mission.

Scholastic Literacy Partner's mission is supporting literacy as a means of bettering the lives of children. As a partner, they help organizations by:

* Building home libraries to foster a culture of literacy
* Providing access to age-appropriate books and collections in your communities
* Stopping the “summer slide” with summer reading take-home packs
* Empowering families to build their children’s literacy skill with reading practice every night in their homes

Sounds like the perfect partner for Maureen's Readers!
