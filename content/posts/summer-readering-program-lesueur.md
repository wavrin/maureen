Maureen's Readers wants to highlight a great summer reading program: The Waseca-Le Sueur Regional Library System's [Universe of Stories](http://wasecalesueurlibraries.com/a-universe-of-stories-summer-reading-program-begins-at-local-libraries/). This is their annual summer reading program for kids and teens.

The program's goal is to combat the "summer slide" of losing essential reading skills during the summer, and also its profound effect on kids of lower socio-economic status - both core parts of Maureen's Readers' mission.
