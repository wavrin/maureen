On this past Saturday, Maureen’s Readers participated as one of the sponsors of the ISD 279 [Reading is Fun 5K Run/Walk](http://www.district279foundation.org/reading-is-fun-5k.html) at Elm Creek Park Reserve in Maple Grove. Proceeds from this event go to the media centers of the schools in the district.

We felt that this is a good cause. We've seen first hand how efficiently the media centers are operated. Because sponsors were allowed to have a table at the event, we felt that this was a great opportunity to present our new organization. We were fortunate to have talked with some people who have/had professional roles in the district. We got some good ideas and fostered some contacts going forward. 

Maureen’s Readers was well received and that made us happy! We have been busy behind the scenes working through some logistics regarding the non-profit. Once school gets back in session we hope to be able to start reporting some meaningful projects we are involved in. We want to be involved in quality programs and events that get books in the hands of kids that are challenged to be able to do that. We are also interested in any program that fosters reading amongst our youth. We are open to and invite your ideas!
