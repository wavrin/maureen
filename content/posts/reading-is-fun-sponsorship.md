Osseo Area Schools' annual [Reading is Fun 5K Run/Walk](http://www.district279foundation.org/reading-is-fun-5k.html) is set for August 10, and Maureen's Readers will be one of the sponsors:

"Lace up your sneakers and team up with the District 279 Foundation and Kidstop (ISD 279 school-aged care program) and participate in the 9th Annual Reading is Fun 5K Run/Walk. This event is chipped timed and will be held on Saturday, August 10 at Elm Creek Park Reserve.

"While everyone loves supporting a good cause, many families also appreciate the health and social benefits of a run/walk. Proceeds from this family-friendly event will be allocated to media centers (library) in Osseo Area Schools to purchase learning resources."

Maureen's grandchildren will run the race, and Maureen's Readers will have a table at the event, handing out information about our organization and free bookmarks.
