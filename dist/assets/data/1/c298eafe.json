September 2019","description":"A roundup of what Maureen's Readers is up to.","content":"<p>I'm are pleased to provide an update on Maureen’s Readers activities. We are excited about some things we have in the works. We have been allocated bookshelf space in a secure cabinet at <a href=\"http://schools.district279.org/rl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice Lake Elementary</a> in Maple Grove for what we're calling a book “stash.” We will keep the cabinet stocked with K-5 reading level books. Teachers will be able to access these books and be able to give them to students who have few or no books at home. The goal is to foster their interest in reading and help build home libraries for these challenged students. Our plan is to duplicate this program in other schools.</p>\n<p>As part of my volunteer activities, I’m working with two second grade students that need help with reading and have significant challenges in their home life. They have no one at home that will read with them. Maureen’s Readers has purchased books that I will read with them and then give to them to help build a home library. My plan is to do this with other students, primarily in the first and second grades. I realize that I can’t do this by myself and so I’m exploring avenues to recruit other volunteers. At this point I’ll put a plug in to encourage you all to consider volunteering at your local elementary school. Working with these young people is most rewarding. </p>\n<p>Maureen’s Readers has also decided to give every Kindergarten student at Rice Lake a book of their own periodically during the year. We feel the earlier a home library can be started the better. We plan to do this at other schools.</p>\n<p>Maureen’s Readers has also committed to provide books for a “book cart” that a teacher in the <a href=\"http://isd2397.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LeSueur-Henderson school district</a> has developed for her students to foster interest in reading. It is gratifying for us that this teacher was a colleague of Maureen’s. We continue to explore ways of fostering reading interest among young people and are open to suggestions from our followers.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
