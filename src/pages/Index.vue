      Maureen (McDermott) Wavrin, mother of Katie, Christopher, and Kelly, was a dedicated
      teacher for 23 years in the Le Sueur-Henderson school district. Most of that time was spent in
      a third grade classroom. She was an ardent reader her whole life. She firmly believed that
      success in school was dependent on good reading skills. She and her teaching team
      implemented “book club” for their students. This was a hit with them and subsequently
      contributed to pronounced improvement in reading and comprehension test scores.

      Maureen retired from teaching in 2010. The following year I retired from dentistry and
      shortly thereafter we moved to Maple Grove to be near our grandchildren. We started
      volunteering at Rice Lake Elementary in 2013 when the grandkids were in Kindergarten. We
      proceeded to follow them up the grades. In second grade Maureen started a book club and
      started with a favorite, Charlotte’s Web. The book club was popular with the students and
      Maureen enjoyed it very much. In the fall of 2015 Maureen developed some health issues and
      during Christmas break she was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a type of blood cancer.
      Thus started a two year battle with this disease. Maureen continued to volunteer and do book
      club despite weekly trips to Mayo for chemotherapy. At first, treatments provided promise and
      hope was present. However, each treatment regimen eventually failed. Maureen started the
      2016 school year volunteering, but had to quit as the treatment regimens became increasingly
      difficult. By Christmas of 2017 she had exhausted her treatment options and her health
      deteriorated quickly. On February 27, 2018 she passed away at Mayo Methodist Hospital.
      She was courageous throughout her fight with this disease. Despite all, she always
      maintained that her life had been blessed in many ways.

      I have continued to volunteer at Rice Lake. I wanted to do something to honor
      Maureen, this dedicated, kind, selfless teacher and mother. Something that would reflect her
      ardent dedication to fostering students interest in reading. Something that would be ongoing
      and sustaining. I had some ideas. Since it would take funds to implement these ideas, my
      family and I decided to start the non-profit Maureen’s Readers to fund any programs we came
      with. Our first project was to subsidize the Rice Lake PTO’s book voucher program for the
      Spring Book Fair. This enabled students that ordinarily would not be able to obtain books
      to call their own a chance to do so. This was successful and it was noted that there were
      some “very happy kids”. We would also like to get some books in the hands of some
      underserved students before school is out in the spring to encourage summer reading.
      Also, the PTO at Rice Lake is working on implementing a school wide book club for the
      next academic year. This would be something Maureen would have enthusiastically supported.
      Maureen’s Readers would underwrite the cost of this program. Our goal is to do things
      that stimulate student’s interest in reading. How we accomplish this will be determined going
      forward by working on project development with ideas we come up and ideas given to us by
      others. We are in the very rudimentary stages at this point. We would like to distribute books
      in a thoughtful, organized way and not just “dump” books on the kids just to say we did.
      We will concentrate our efforts on Rice Lake immediately, but we are open to and in fact will
      attempt to expand to other schools and programs.
